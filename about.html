title: About this model.
---
A large number of people have developed models for predicting the outcomes of college basketball games. For those that have made their picks publicly available, <a href="http://www.thepredictiontracker.com/basketball.php">ThePredictionTracker</a> does a great service by tracking the live performance of each model over the course of the season. Unfortunately, it's difficult to do a direct comparison of models using the summary page on the Tracker, for a couple of reasons. For one, each model has predicted a different subset of games (in many cases this is accidental -- schedules get modified and web scrapers don't pick up the changes -- but some models don't start making picks altogether until weeks or months into the season). Further, there are a few misprinted lines in the Tracker data. For example, the Tracker shows an opening line of -22 and a closing line of +64.5 for UCLA vs. Presbyterian on 11/19/2019 (the line closed at -23 or -23.5 depending on the book). 
<br><br>
Throughout the 2018-19 season, I'll try to update this page with some further analysis of the Tracker data. For what follows, I chose a subset of models which have made picks since the very beginning of the season, and I threw out games for which any of those models did not make a pick. Morever, in a (somewhat lazy) attempt to address misprinted lines, I filtered out any games for which the opening and closing lines differed by more than 5 points (it's very rare that this really happens).
