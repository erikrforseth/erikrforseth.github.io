  <p>I study radiation reaction and the two-body problem in Einstein's general theory of relativity (GR). Much like accelerated charged particles emit electromagnetic (EM) radiation, masses undergoing certain kinds of motion are known to emit gravitational radiation, or <i>gravitational waves</i> (GWs), which take the form of ripples in the curvature of spacetime. These waves have not yet been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16">directly</a> detected, but several new experiments promise to soon inaugurate the era of gravitational wave astronomy.</p>
  
  <p>As two massive bodies orbit one another, the emission of gravitational radiation carries energy and angular momentum out of the binary, driving an inspiral and eventual merger. Certain classes of such binary systems will be a primary source for detectable GWs by the next generation of experiments. These GWs will carry a great deal of information about the systems from which they were produced, but there will be a high level of noise associated with near-term detections. In order to extract system parameters from the signal, it will be necessary to have a bank of very accurate waveform templates so that a matched filtering procedure can be performed. Therefore, the dynamics of the orbital evolution must be known to a high degree of accuracy.</p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately, the two-body problem is not known to be exactly solvable in GR. Whereas EM is a linear theory because EM fields are not themselves charged, the field equations of GR are highly nonlinear; roughly, gravitational fields carry energy, and can therefore in turn source gravitational fields. So, various approximation schemes must be invoked in order to understand how binary systems evolve, and it is important that these be refined as much as possible in order to provide accurate templates for matched filtering.</p>

  <p>At present, there are three leading approaches. Numerical relativity (NR) consists of attempts to directly evolve Einstein's equations in the time domain (TD), and for computational reasons this is best done for comparable-mass, closely-separated binaries. Post-Newtonian (PN) theory is an analytic approximation valid for slow-moving (and therefore widely-separated) binaries, and involves expanding the equations in powers of the small orbital velocity. Finally, black hole perturbation theory (BHPT) is an expansion in small mass ratio m/M, useful when the orbiting body's mass m is much less than the larger body's mass M. These orbits are called exreme-mass-ratio-inspirals (EMRIs). My work has been primarily concerned with BHPT, or <q>gravitational self-force</q> (GSF), and lately with using BHPT to inform PN theory.</p>
