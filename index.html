  <p>For the past couple of years, a hobby of mine has been writing code to predict the outcomes of college basketball games.</p>

  <p>I submit picks to the <a href="http://www.thepredictiontracker.com/basketball.php">Prediction Tracker</a> under the moniker "ERFunctionRatings."
  <p>If you're at all interested in this sort of thing, I don't think there's a better resource than Scott Turner's <a href = "http://netprophetblog.blogspot.com/">Net Prophet</a> blog.</p>
