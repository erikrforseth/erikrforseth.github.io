  <h2>NCAA basketball prediction</h2>
  
  <hr>
  <p> Game predictions will resume shortly after the 2016-2017 season begins.</p>
  <p> <a href="/rankings.html">Final 2016 post-tournament rankings are here</a>. </p>
  <p> Compare my rankings with those of other systems at <a href="http://www.masseyratings.com/cb/compare.htm">Massey Ratings</a>!</p>
  <hr>

  <p>I submit picks to the <a href="http://www.thepredictiontracker.com/basketball.php">Prediction Tracker</a> under the moniker "ERFunctionRatings."
  <p>If you're at all interested in this sort of thing, I don't think there's a better resource than Scott Turner's <a href = "http://netprophetblog.blogspot.com/">Net Prophet</a> blog.</p>
