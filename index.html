	<h2>Erik R. Forseth</h2>
	<p>I'm a sixth-year graduate student in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at UNC-Chapel Hill. I work with Dr. Charles R. Evans on approximations in Einstein's general theory of relativity, particularly the interface of the gravitational self-force (GSF) and post-Newtonian (PN) formalisms. More on my research can be found <a href="
