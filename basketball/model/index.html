  <h2>About the model</h2>
  <p>
    I use a linear regression system trained on 25,000+ regular season games from 2010-2016, which takes as input a number of season-to-date team statistics, some of which are raw (e.g. average margin of victory) and most of which are adjusted according to teams' opponents' statistics. For these adjusted measures, I use several independent routines. Some of these are original, and some of these are generalizations of preexisting methods (e.g. RPI-like ratings).
