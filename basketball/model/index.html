  <h2>About the model</h2>
  <p>
    My model is a linear regression formula trained on 20,000+ regular season games from 2011-2015, which takes as input a number of season-to-date team statistics (including some products of these statistics), some of which are raw (e.g. average margin of victory) and some of which are adjusted according to the team's opponents' statistics. For these adjusted measures, I use something of a generalization of Andrew Dolphin's "infinite" RPI routine, described <a href="http://netprophetblog.blogspot.com/2011/04/infinitely-deep-rpi.html">here</a> and <a href="/basketball/RPInotes.pdf">here</a>. For most of the analysis that goes into this, I use <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>, <a href="http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/">statsmodels</a>, and <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a>, though I wrote my own routines for things like feature selection.
