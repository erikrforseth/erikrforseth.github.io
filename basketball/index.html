  <p>For the past year or so, a hobby of mine has been writing code to predict the outcomes of college basketball games; this evolved partly as an exercise to teach myself some Python and machine learning techniques, and partly as a new way to follow my favorite sport.</p>

  <p>After getting up and running last year, I began submitting daily picks to the <a href="http://www.thepredictiontracker.com/basketball.php">Prediction Tracker</a> under the moniker "ERFunctionRatings," which I've continued to do for this 2015-2016 season. The model's performance has taken a hit this year, but the performance of the other predictors has suffered as well. This may or may not be related to <a href="http://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2015-06-08/ncaa-changes-shot-clock-30-seconds-makes-other-changes-game">rule changes</a>, or it may just be a generally "noisy" season this year. Regardless, I'm often tinkering with this project in my ever-vanishing free time, and have some potential improvements coming down the pike for next season.</p>

  <p>Finally, if you're at all interested in this sort of thing, I don't think there's a better resource out there than Scott Turner's <a href = "http://netprophetblog.blogspot.com/">Net Prophet</a> blog.</p>
