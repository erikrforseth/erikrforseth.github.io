  <p>For the past couple of years, a hobby of mine has been writing code to predict the outcomes of college basketball games.</p>

  <p>I submit picks to the <a href="http://www.thepredictiontracker.com/basketball.php">Prediction Tracker</a> under the moniker "ERFunctionRatings." 
  <p> For some information about the model, see <a href="/basketball/model">here</a>. </p>
  <p>Finally, if you're at all interested in this sort of thing, I don't think there's a better resource out there than Scott Turner's <a href = "http://netprophetblog.blogspot.com/">Net Prophet</a> blog.</p>
