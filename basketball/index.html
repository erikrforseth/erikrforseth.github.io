  <p>For the past year or so, a hobby of mine has been writing code to predict the outcomes of college basketball games; this evolved partly as an exercise to teach myself some Python and machine learning techniques, and partly as a new way to follow my favorite sport.</p>

  <p>After getting up and running last year, I began submitting picks to the <a href="http://www.thepredictiontracker.com/basketball.php">Prediction Tracker</a> under the moniker "ERFunctionRatings", where I did pretty well! I only became aware of the Tracker about mid-way through the season, and so I began submitting picks on Jan. 13, 2015. For the period of games starting Jan. 13 and going through the end of the 2014-2015 regular season, here's a comparison of how the various predictors (including my model) performed:</p>

  <p>Here, a lower MSE is better; it's an indication of the difference between the prediction and the actual result.</p>
  <p>Now, given that this seems to be sort of an elite group, I was pretty happy -- and keep in mind that the an MSE of 110 and an MSE of 105 are only different by about 0.24 in RMSE (root mean square error)!</p>
  <p>During the offseason, I made improvements to my model that brought this measure down to about ~107-108 on this set of games. What I never managed to do, however, was find the time to tackle very-early-season predictions, for which things are pretty dicey (if only I could focus on this sort of thing full-time...). Not only have you not got much season-to-date data to go on, all the non-conference blowouts really inject some noise. So, on Dec. 1 I began posting picks once again, here and on <a href="http://www.thepredictiontracker.com/predbb.html">the Tracker</a>; unfortunately, things got off to a rocky start! I have some ideas about why this might be, so look for some (hopefully) improved performance shortly. Besides, games will settle down soon, and I would expect some regression toward the mean regardless. </p>

  <p>Finally, if you're at all interested in this sort of thing, I don't think there's a better resource out there than Scott Turner's <a href = "http://netprophetblog.blogspot.com/">Net Prophet</a> blog.</p>
