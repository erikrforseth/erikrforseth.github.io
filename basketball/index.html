  <h2>NCAA basketball prediction and analytics</h2>
  <p>For the past couple of years, a hobby of mine has been writing code to predict the outcomes of college basketball games; this evolved partly as an exercise to teach myself some Python and machine learning techniques, and partly as a new way to follow my favorite sport. For the upcoming 2015-2016 season, I'll be posting regular-season game predictions here. I'll also be submitting these picks to the <a href="http://www.thepredictiontracker.com/basketball.php">Prediction Tracker</a>, where you can follow my performance. I did quite well <a href = "http://www.thepredictiontracker.com/bbresults.php">last year</a> (submitting under the moniker "ERFunctionRatings"), though my performance was slightly inflated since I started submitting picks a bit later in the season (when I first became aware of the Prediction Tracker). This year I plan to begin submitting after about three games into the season.</p>

  <p>Finally, if you're at all interested in this sort of thing, I don't think there's a better resource out there than Scott Turner's <a href = "http://netprophetblog.blogspot.com/">Net Prophet</a> blog.</p>
