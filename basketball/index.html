  <h2>NCAA Basketball Prediction and Analytics</h2>
  <p>For the past couple of years, a hobby of mine has been writing code to predict the outcomes of college basketball games; this evolved partly as an exercise to teach myself some Python and machine learning techniques, and partly as a new way to follow my favorite sport. For the upcoming 2015-2016 season, I'll be posting regular-season game predictions here. I'll also be submitting these picks to the <a href="http://www.thepredictiontracker.com/basketball.php">Prediction Tracker</a>, where you can follow my performance. I did quite well <a href = "http://www.thepredictiontracker.com/bbresults.php">last year</a> (submitting under the moniker "ERFunctionRatings"), though my performance was slightly inflated since I started submitting picks a bit later in the season.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, I'm an even bigger fan of NBA basketball, but one of the things that drew me to college ball was the problem of conferences and strength-of-schedule. There are over 300 Division I college teams, but each team plays a majority of its 27-29 regular season games against opponents belonging to its own conference. Of course, not all conferences are created equal, and for this reason it is essential to have some way of adjusting measures of a team's quality according to the strength of its opposition. One such schedule-adjusted measure is the oft-maligned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rating_Percentage_Index">RPI</a> rating, which takes into account a team's winning percentage, as well as the average winning percentages of its opponents and its opponents' opponents. The weights used in the RPI formula are often thought of being arbitrary, but I do not think this is actually the case. I've written up some <a href="/basketball/RPInotes.pdf">notes</a> describing a "derivation" of the standard formula for RPI, as well as a discussion of some of its generalizations. Though RPI is quite limited when used as the sole indicator of a team's strength, these generalizations (especially when applied to statistics besides win-loss record) can be quite useful. Suggestions and criticism of these notes are welcome.</p>

  <p>If you're at all interested in this sort of thing, I don't think there's a better resource out there than Scott Turner's <a href = "http://netprophetblog.blogspot.com/">Net Prophet</a> blog.</p>
