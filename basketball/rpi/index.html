  <h2>Strength of schedule</h2>
  <p>Truth be told, I'm an even bigger fan of NBA basketball, but one of the things that drew me to college games was the problem of conferences and strength of schedule. There are over 300 Division I college teams, but each of those teams plays a majority of its 27-29 regular season games against opponents belonging to its own conference. Of course, not all conferences are created equal, and for this reason it is essential to have some way of adjusting measures of a team's quality according to the strength of its opposition. One such schedule-adjusted measure is the oft-maligned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rating_Percentage_Index">RPI</a> rating, which takes into account a team's winning percentage, as well as the average winning percentages of its opponents and its opponents' opponents. The weights used in the RPI formula are often thought of as being arbitrary, but I do not think this is actually the case. I've written up some <a href="/basketball/RPInotes.pdf">notes</a> describing a "derivation" of the standard formula for RPI, as well as a discussion of some of its generalizations. Though RPI is quite limited when used as the sole indicator of a team's strength, these generalizations (especially when applied to statistics besides win-loss record) can be quite useful. Suggestions and criticism of these notes are welcome.</p>
